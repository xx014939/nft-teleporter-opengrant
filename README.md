# NFT Teleporter

NFT Teleporter is a no code web application which allows users to create NFT's and NFT collections without writing a single line of code. Users can customise their 
collections smart contract, attributes and meta data rarity without ever needing to hire a developer. They can deploy their collection on the Solana test net or main net
as well as other blockchains if they so choose, as well as list their collections for sale in popular marketplaces all with the click of a button.

In addition to this, we offer users the ability to not just create NFT collections with their art work, but also teleport that artwork into the Metaverse with pre-made 
web based interactive experiences in VR, AR and other mediums. We also offer a simple rest API to retrieve the assets used in these experiences, if the user wishes to invest in a development team in the future to build upon the original collections offerings.
