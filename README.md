# NFT Teleporter

NFT Teleporter is a no code web application which allows users to create NFT's and NFT collections without writing a single line of code. Users can customise their 
collections smart contract, attributes and meta data rarity without ever needing to hire a developer. They can deploy their collection on the Ethereum, BSC or Polygon test net or main net as well as other blockchains if they so choose, as well as list their collections for sale in popular marketplaces all with the click of a button.

In addition to this, we offer users the ability to not just create NFT collections with their art work, but also teleport that artwork into the Metaverse with pre-made 
web based interactive experiences in VR, AR and other mediums. We also offer a simple rest API to retrieve the assets used in these experiences, if the user wishes to invest in a development team in the future to build upon the original collections offerings.

## Important Info!!!

Upon creating a new account your wallet balance will be zero. Because of this you won't be able to deploy a smart contract or mint an NFT through the UI. We are working on a dynamic faucet to automatically give new users Goerli ETH, however in the meantime please take your wallets public address from the account section after logging in and send some test ETH to it.

A good faucet is - https://goerlifaucet.com/

Alternatively you may import your wallet into Metamask by copying the private key inside your account section, however this isn't necessary unless you also want to view your NFT's on OpenSea.
